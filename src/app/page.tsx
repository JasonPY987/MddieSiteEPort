              I'm based in the Shreveport-Bossier area and hold a Bachelor's in Management & Administration with a minor in Cybersecurity from LSUS. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University. My academic background blends management principles with technical cybersecurity skills, which allows me to approach challenges with a comprehensive, strategic mindset.

              Beyond academics, I'm proud to be the co-founder of Lambda Nu Chi, a nontraditional, service-driven sorority at LSUS. We're dedicated to empowering diverse women, particularly those who are passionate about academics, leadership, and community service. Our organization is built around fostering an inclusive, supportive environment where women can excel in their studies, develop leadership skills, and contribute to the community through hands-on service initiatives.

              At Lambda Nu Chi, we aim to break barriers and redefine what it means to be a leader, supporting our members as they thrive academically, socially, and professionally. I'm proud of the space we've created, where we can help young women build the confidence, skills, and experiences necessary to excel in their personal and professional lives. We've been featured in a few articles, highlighting our mission and impact in the local community:

              I'm passionate about the potential of cybersecurity to empower individuals and protect our future. My goal is to build a strong foundation in defensive cybersecurityâ€”protecting systems, supporting professionals, and helping everyday people live and work with peace of mind. With a mindset focused on securing technology, I'm driven to contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world.
